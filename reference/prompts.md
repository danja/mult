The file reference/index.html contains a data visualization I'd like you to use as the basis for an RDF visualization tool. As first steps I'd like you to create a Vite project and using the RDF-Ext library as the data container convert the data into an RDF representation. The data should be persisted in data/universe.ttl . This should be loaded and made visible in the same manner as in the index.html example. Follow general best practices and Vite conventions to create this project. It will need tests and a README.md.
